        <i>Stuck</i> is an attempt at poetry (re)generated and remixed out of various bits of the internet and its intended and unintended archives, taking snippets from digitized magazines and ephemeral print, social media posts and search engine results, news sites and various public domain books.
<br><br>
The writing process loosely follows the chance-based writing methods of the Dadaists and other actors of the European avant-garde, alongside the use of online OCR scanners, text-to-speech apps, sometimes LLM AIs, and various glitch-art methods of joyfully destroying a file to see what wonderful things arise from the wreckage. <i> Stuck </i> is often realised through online and offline group workshops, where we negotiate with the language, the internet, ourselves and each other.
<br><br>
This work is a part of a larger art research interested in the lack of imagination that plagues societies under late-capitalism, preventing us to imagine sustainable and kinder futures. 
<br><br>
Nostalgia is a story, it might be the only type of imagination and storytelling we are still allowed to indulge in, but that's only if nostalgia is kept docgile, and the past keeps forgetting it used to be able to remember the future. A part of the antidote to capitalist realism might just be feral fabulation
of the future and meticulous fact-checking of data we come into contact with.
<br><br>
The research consults and references Svetlana Boym's work on nostalgia, Mark Fisher's ideas about lost futures, Duchamp's <i>infrathin</i>, language playwork of Gerturde Stein's <i>Tender Buttons</i> and Joyce's <i>Ulysses</i>, among others.
<br><br>
Currently this work-in-progress consist of digital collages, poetry, audio recordings and divination cards.</p>

    <p style="color: #dd9926;"><span style="color: blue;">Teuta Gatolin</span> is an intermedia artist based in Croatia, currently researching storytelling ecology, the subversive potential of mythological tricksters, nostalghia, illusion, and technology as one of the companion species to humans. Her work is often process-oriented, spawning iterations of itself realized with other fabulators. Her works have taken the shape of installation, text, collections of objects, workshops, letters, costumes, virtual spaces and a range of mixes, mashups and negotiations between various art media. She studied New Media Arts and Animated film at the Fine Art Academy, and Journalism/Media Studies at the Faculty of Political Sciences, both in Zagreb, Croatia. She loves to collaborate. </p>
